# Added by OrbStack: 'orb' SSH host for Linux machines
# This only works if it's at the top of ssh_config (before any Host blocks).
# This won't be added again if you remove it.
Include ~/.orbstack/ssh/config

# NOTE: This might need 1Password SSH to be properly configured to play well.
# Might also need to enable the config generation from 1Password > Developer (left sidebar)
# > SSH settings
Include ~/.ssh/1Password/config
